What is kwhois?
--------------
kwhois is maden that easy search Korea local domain with whois command.
It is supported InterNic(com,net,org), eNic(cc), ToNic(to) and JpNic(jp)

A point of difference with fwhois?
---------------------------------

Default Whois server of fwhois is rs.internic.net(INTERNIC- com,net,org).
And for search korea local domain, used whois as follow;

whois domain.co.kr@whois.krnic.net or
whois domain.co.kr@whois.nic.or.kr

So, solved this inconvenience, kwhois was designed
